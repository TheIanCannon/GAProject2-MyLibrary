[App: Heroku](https://project-palanthas.herokuapp.com/)\
    2.1. Upon loading, the app will display the HOME page, and a vertical nav bar on its left. An unsigned visitor can visit the library or return to the Home page. They can also sign in, to add titles, review a title, or create their own collection from available titles.\

    2.2. The BROWSE LIBRARY option allows a user, signed in or not, to view the collection of currently-available titles, as well as read any reviews attached to titles. A signed-in user is able to add or delete their own reviews, as well as update information on any title they have personally created.\

    2.3. From the Library or Your Collection link, a user can access individual titles, to get data about the book or read any other user reviews.\

    2.6. The YOUR COLLECTION option allows a signed-in user to create their own personal bookcase. They can add or remove shelves (each with its own name and note), and add or remove titles extant in the Library; these provide direct links to each book's information and reviews.\
\
    2.7 The SIGN IN / SIGN OUT option allows the user access to all functionality available.\
\
*3. Next Steps*\
\
    3.1. Add cover image to each title created.\
\
    3.2. Information on authors (especially with multiple titles).\
\
    3.2. Reviews for authors.\
\
    3.3. Add guest-book comment space for unsigned visitors.\
\
    3.4. BIG TICKET: Substitute API (from Library of Congress?) in place of data entry on titles/authors.\
\
    3.5. REALLY BIG TICKET: Connect users with 3+ titles in common.
