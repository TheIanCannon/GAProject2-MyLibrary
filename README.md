    Named for a fictional city with an arcane library at its heart, this app allows the user to add to a collection of titles, and create reviews and collectionsâ€”and you don't even need an acceptance letter to Hogwart's!\

*2. Getting Started*\
\
[App: Heroku](https://project-palanthas.herokuapp.com/)\
    2.1. Upon loading, the app will display the HOME page, and a vertical nav bar on its left. An unsigned visitor can visit the library or return to the Home page. They can also sign in, to add titles, review a title, or create their own collection from available titles.\

    2.2. The BROWSE LIBRARY option allows a user, signed in or not, to view the collection of currently-available titles, as well as read any reviews attached to titles. A signed-in user is able to add or delete their own reviews, as well as update information on any title they have personally created.\

    2.3. From the Library or Your Collection link, a user can access individual titles, to get data about the book or read any other user reviews.

    2.6. The YOUR COLLECTION option allows a signed-in user to create their own personal bookcase. They can add or remove shelves (each with its own name and note), and add or remove titles extant in the Library; these provide direct links to each book's information and reviews.\
\
    2.7 The SIGN IN / SIGN OUT option allows the user access to all functionality available.\
\
*3. Next Steps*\
\
    3.1. Expanded tracking options: Counters for "rounds played" and/or "amount won".\
\
    3.1.1. Digit-by-digit counting-out of winnings adding to credits.\
\
    3.1. More realistically "animated" reel gif (vertical slide effect?) or animated lever movement; animated wager payout?\
\
    3.2. Flashing lights "behind" the reels, or other simple visuals to decorate the page (similar to realspace or online slot machines of various types).\
\
    3.4. BIG TICKET: Expanded control options i.e. "nudge" switches for each reel (spending extra wager for each), multiple paylines (horizontal/diagonal).
